# Addressing Delays and Accessibility to Enhance MTA Subway User Experience

## Overview
This project was developed by myself and three colleagues to analyze the delays and accessibility of the NYC Subway system. We adopted a two-pronged approach, focusing on these key factors as they significantly impact user experience. The project consists of two separate code files—one dedicated to delays and the other to accessibility. Our key findings are summarized and visualized in the accompanying presentation. 

The data used for this project can be accessed on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jkanishkhajai/mta-nyc-dataset).

## Key Findings
Our analysis revealed several critical insights into subway delays and accessibility in NYC. Key takeaways include:
- **Delays:** Patterns of congestion, peak-hour disruptions, and frequent service interruptions in certain lines.
- **Accessibility:** Challenges faced by riders with mobility impairments due to station design and elevator availability.
- **Correlation:** A relationship between high-delay stations and lower accessibility ratings, highlighting systemic issues in the subway network.

## Common Packages and Libraries Used
This project utilizes several essential Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, including:
- `pandas` – For data manipulation and cleaning
- `numpy` – For numerical computations
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – For data visualization
- `geopandas` – For mapping and spatial analysis
- `scikit-learn` – For any relevant machine learning applications

We hope this project provides valuable insights into improving the MTA subway experience by addressing delays and enhancing accessibility.
