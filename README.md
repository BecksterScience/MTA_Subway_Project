## Project Overview
This project was developed by myself and three colleagues to analyze the delays and accessibility of the NYC Subway system. We adopted a two-pronged approach, focusing on these key factors as they significantly impact user experience. The project consists of two separate code files—one dedicated to delays and the other to accessibility. Our key findings are summarized and visualized in the accompanying presentation. 

The data used for this project can be accessed on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jkanishkhajai/mta-nyc-dataset).

## Key Findings
Our analysis revealed several critical insights into subway delays and accessibility in NYC. Key takeaways include:
- **Delays:** Patterns of congestion, peak-hour disruptions, and frequent service interruptions in certain lines. The delays differ by line and by train some being worse off than others.
- **Accessibility:** MTA should increase the number of ADA complient stations. It is extremely hard for individuals with ambulatory difficulties to get around without the proper accommodations. Out of the four major boroughs, no borough has even 50% complience among its stations. Accessibility differs amongst boroughs potentially indicating poorer accessibility in less affluent areas. Areas with highest density of individuals with ambulatory difficulty are not properly served by MTA.
- **Correlation:** A relationship between high-delay stations and lower accessibility ratings, highlighting systemic issues in the subway network.

## Common Packages and Libraries Used
This project utilizes several essential Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, including:
- `pandas` – For data manipulation and cleaning
- `numpy` – For numerical computations
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – For data visualization
- `geopandas` – For mapping and spatial analysis
- `scikit-learn` – For any relevant machine learning applications

We hope this project provides valuable insights into improving the MTA subway experience by addressing delays and enhancing accessibility.
